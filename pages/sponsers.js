              Ben 10 API is totally free to use and always will be. It was a fun project, built
              from scratch & maintained solely by me and doing that needed both time & energy.
              With your help I can continue to maintain the project. Donations are highly
              appreciated. All the sponsers & donations with their profile will be updated here
              as well as on the Github Repository. Thank you :)
