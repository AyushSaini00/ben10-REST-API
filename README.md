![Ben 10 API](https://github.com/AyushSaini00/ben10-REST-API/blob/main/public/logo.png)

## Overview
A RESTful API serving hand curated Ben 10 Aliens data, built with Express & MongoDB.

## Why am I doing this?
A while ago when I was learning Javascript by building [projects](https://60minutejs.vercel.app/), I thought of building an app that will show a random alien card everytime user refreshes the page but I couldn't find a single API that can provide me the data. So as a developer, I planned to build this myself and as Ben 10 was my favourite childhood cartoon series I knew I could finish the project without leaving it in the middle.
