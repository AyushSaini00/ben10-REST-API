![Ben 10 API](https://github.com/AyushSaini00/ben10-REST-API/blob/main/public/logo.png)

## Overview 🎉
A RESTful API serving hand curated Ben 10 Aliens data, built with Express & MongoDB. [Explore](https://ben10api.vercel.app)

## Why am I doing this? ✍
A while ago when I was learning Javascript by building [projects](https://60minutejs.vercel.app/), I thought of building an app that will show a random alien card everytime user refreshes the page but I couldn't find a single API that can provide me the data. So as a developer, I planned to build this myself and as Ben 10 was my favourite childhood cartoon series I knew I could finish the project without leaving it in the middle.

## Getting Started 🚀
- Visit the docs page on [ben10api.vercel.app](https://ben10api.vercel.app)

## Support 🙌
Ben 10 API is totally free to use and always will be. It was a fun project, built from scratch & maintained solely by me and doing that needed both time & energy. With your help I can continue to maintain the project. Donations are highly appreciated. All the sponsers & donations with there profile will be updated here as well as on the site. Thank you :)
